Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Laura Waller. My research is in computational optics, which is a combination of optical hardware, physical modeling, optimization algorithms, and machine learning.

# Research Projects


## Physics-based learning: Algorithms and optics co-design
Eric Markley*, __Fanglin Linda Liu*__(equal contribution), Michael Kellman, Nick Antipa, and Laura Waller\\

We use a differentiable forward model of single-shot 3D microscopy in conjunction with an invertible and differentiable reconstruction algorithm, ISTA-Net<sup>+</sup>, to jointly optimize both the diffuser surface shape and the reconstruction parameters for Fourier DiffuserScope.  By choosing a differentiable and invertible reconstruction method, we enable the use of memory-efficient backpropagation to trade off storage with a reasonable increase in compute time, in order to fit an unrolled network containing a large-scale 3D volume into a single GPU's memory.

## Fourier DiffuserScope: Single-shot 3D Microscopy with a diffuser
__Fanglin Linda Liu__, Grace Kuo, Nick Antipa, Laura Waller\\
[Optics Express 28, 28969 (2020)](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-28-20-28969&id=439689)
<p align="justify">
We demonstrate improved resolution across a large volume with Fourier DiffuserScope, which uses a diffuser in the pupil plane to encode 3D information, then computationally reconstructs the volume by solving a sparsity-constrained inverse problem. Our diffuser consists of randomly placed microlenses with varying focal lengths; the random positions provide a larger field-of-view compared to a conventional microlens array, and the diverse focal lengths improve the axial depth range.

## On chip fluorescence microscopy with a random microlens diffuser

[Optics Express 28, 8384 (2020)](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-28-6-8384&id=428841)
<p align="justify">
We present an on-chip, widefield fluorescence microscope, which consists of a diffuser placed a few millimeters away from a traditional image sensor. The diffuser replaces the optics of a microscope, resulting in a compact and easy-to-assemble system with a practical working distance of over 1.5 mm. Furthermore, the diffuser encodes volumetric information, enabling refocusability in post-processing and 3D imaging of sparse samples from a single acquisition.
